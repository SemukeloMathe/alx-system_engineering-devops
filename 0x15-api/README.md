This repo contains solutions to tasks of Alx project on API

What is an API?
To my understanding:
API stands for Application Programming Interface and it is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.
API specifies how software components should interact.
A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. The programmer then puts the building blocks together.
